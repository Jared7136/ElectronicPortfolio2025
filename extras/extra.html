<p id="description"> My main hobby growing up has always been playing video games. My first experience was playing on the wii with my family, and it stands as a really happy memory today. Somewhere along the line, like around 6th or 7th grade, was when my brother built me my first pc, I remember him having me tighten the screws in because I didn't know much about computers at the time and my brother wanted me to help. Since then regular pc maintenance and upgrading my pc has always been something that I enjoy greatly. Technology has always been fascinating to me growing up. It was a really cool feeling when I first interacted it. Some of my other side hobbies include stuff like reading, listening to music, and watching tv shows. There are times when I just put on some music and get lost in a new book I'm reading for hours on end. </p>
